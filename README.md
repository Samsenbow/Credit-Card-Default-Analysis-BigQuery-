# SBA Loan Default Analysis (Work in Progress)

This repository contains my ongoing analysis using the **BigQuery Public Dataset**  
[`bigquery-public-data.sba_loans`](<https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/sba-loans>).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore **credit risk patterns** and build a predictive model  
to estimate the likelihood of **loan default** among small business borrowers in the United States.

## Key Objectives
- Query and process real-world loan data using **Google BigQuery (SQL)**  
- Perform **data analysis** and **feature engineering**  
- Build a **predictive model** (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree)  
- Visualize trends in loan defaults by **state, industry, and loan amount**

## Tools
- Google BigQuery (Public Datasets)
- R / Python for data analysis and modeling
- GitHub for project documentation and version control

## Current Status
This project is currently in development.  
I am in the process of exploring and cleaning the dataset before moving into modeling.  
The repository will be updated with notebooks, SQL queries, and visualizations as the project progresses.

## Notes
This project connects my **banking background** with my current focus on **data analysis** and  
the practical application of **machine learning in credit risk modeling**.

Stay tuned for updates!
