# Credit Card Default Analysis (Work in Progress)

This repository contains an ongoing analysis of the **Credit Card Default** dataset  
(`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.credit_card_default`) from BigQuery Public Datasets.  
The dataset includes anonymized information on credit card clients, their demographic attributes, payment history, and whether they defaulted on their next month’s payment.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore patterns of credit card defaults and understand the factors associated with higher risk.  
It is intended as a practice project for **SQL queries, data exploration, and preliminary data analysis**, with the possibility of extending it to predictive modeling in the future.

## Current Objectives
The initial analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. **Average Default Rate:**  
   - What is the overall rate of default payments among clients?

2. **Demographic Variation:**  
   - How does the probability of default payment vary by different demographic variables such as education, sex, age, and marital status?

3. **Credit Limit Impact:**  
   - Does the client’s credit limit correlate with their probability of default?

4. **Predictive Variables:**  
   - Which variables appear to be the strongest predictors of default payment?

> These objectives will be expanded as the analysis progresses, including further feature exploration, data visualization, and potential modeling.

## Tools & Technologies
- **BigQuery** for data querying and aggregation
- **SQL** for data manipulation and analysis
- **R / Python** for potential modeling and visualization
- **GitHub** for version control and project documentation

## Current Status
This project is currently in development.  
The repository will be updated with SQL queries, notebooks, visualizations, and insights as work progresses.
